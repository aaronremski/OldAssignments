COT3100 Homework 1 Solutions

1.4.2 

a. {x | x in N, -1<x<13, 3 divides x}

b. {x| x in N –4<x<4}

c. {x| x is a Roman letter, l<x<q}



1.4.4

B subset of A, C subset of A, C subset of D



1.4.14

Yes.  Why?

Fact: Since A is a subset of A, there is a subset of A containing z if and only if z is in A 

(draw a picture and/or think about it).

This means that the one-place union of the powerset of A is A. :

U(P(A))= (by def. of union)

{z | there is a x in P(A) and z in x}=(by def. of power set)

{z | there is a subset x of A and z in x}=(by Fact)

{z | z in A} = (obviously) A.

Also applying this argument to B gives U(P(B))=B.

So , If P(A) is P(B), then 

A=U(P(A))=U(P(B))=B, so A=B.  



1.5.4

A is a subset of B, so 

a. A union B is B

b. A intersect B is A

c. A-B is empty

d. B-A={f,g,h}


1.5.16

Why is (A - B) - C = (A - B) - (C - B)?  This is really a kind of if and 
only if statement: for any element x, 
x  is in (A - B) - C if and only if x is in (A - B) - (C - B). 
To check this, we have look at some element x and go both ways along 
the if-and-only-if double-arrow.
We examine all the possibilities. (You could draw a table....)
( ==> )
 First direction.
 So, suppose we start off with x in (A - B) - C.  This means x is in A, and 
 x is not in B, and, furthermore, x is not in C either.  
 We want to find out that x is in x is in (A - B) - (C - B).
 (Remember, this means x would be in A - B and not in C - B.)
 Since x is not in C, x is certainly not in C - B.  
 Also, x is in A, and x is not in B, so x is in A - B.  But all this means 
 x is in (A - B) - (C - B). 
( <== )
 Second direction.
 Now we start off with x in (A - B) - (C - B).  This means x 
 is in A - B and not in C - B.  Breaking A - B down further, this means 
 x is in A and  x is not in B.  Now we have to look at x not being in C - B.
 Not being in C - B means that either 
 x was never in C in the first place, or, if it was, it must have 
 been in B so that it would get taken out of C - B. But we know the second 
 possibility 
 cannot happen:  x is not 
 in B because x is in A - B.  So x is not in C.  So x is in A- - B, but 
 x is not in C, so x is in (A - B) - C. 
 

1.6.2

a. No -- this is not well-defined --- for example, we do not know whether f(2) is supposed 

to be 2 or -2.

b. Not clear: Yes, if we mean the positive square root, but no, if we mean anything that 

could be a square root, since then it is just like (a) above.

c. No, this is undefined for -2 and +2.



1.6.10

We have to check whether f(n)=f(m) always makes it so that n=m.

a. Yes: n-1=m-1 means n=m.

b. No: ((-2)-squared +1 is the same as 2-squared +1, but -2 is not 2.

c. Yes, n-cubed = m-cubed always means n=m.

d. No, ceiling of 3/2 is the same as ceiling of 4/2, but 3 is not 4.



1.6.16

f[S] = {f(x) | x in S}

a. {1}, since f(x) is always 1.

b. {-1,1,5,9,15}

c. {0,1,2}

d. {0,1,5,16}
