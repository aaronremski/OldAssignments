2.1.2 
I only write the properties they lack.  
Each one has the properties it does not lack.
a. 
not finite because 2n grows forever
b.
not effective on all inputs: if n is not negative, 
then eventually m := 1/n is division by zero
c.
not definite because i is never assigned a value
(also not finite if i has any value < 10)
d.
not definite: we don't know which to choose

2.1.4
function power(x: real; n: integer) : integer;
num := 1;
if n < 0 then m := -n
else m:= n;
for j := 1 to m do
	num := x * num;
if n < 0 then return(1/num)
else return(num);

2.1.12
function last_small_place(A : list) : integer;
place := 1;
small := A[1];
for j := 2 to length(A) do
	if A[j] <= small then 
		begin
		small := A[j];
		place := j;
		end;
return(place);
