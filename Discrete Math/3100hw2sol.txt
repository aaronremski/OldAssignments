Just observe that the bad line in the table will be where 
-q is true and -p is false, which is the same as 
q is false and p is true.	 The table is below.

1.6.14
I'll do the first one in full detail, and abbreviate the other three.

a. -3x+4=-3y+4 implies
	-3x=-3y implies
	3x=3y implies
	x=y
So the function is 1-1.
-3x+4=z has the solution
x=(z-4)/-3, which is always a real number;
so the function is onto. So it is a bijection.

b. Since 2 and -2 go to the same place, this function is not 1-1, so 
it can't be a bijection.  
(It is also not onto, since the value of the 
output is always less than 7, a sort-of obvious fact that 
you can actually prove using the mean value theorem that you 
should learn about in calculus class.)

c. This expression is undefined at -2, so it is not even a function, much 
less a bijection.

d. This is a bijection.  You should already know that fifth powers can 
take on negative values, so we can hit everything in R as an output.
Also, fifth roots are unique, so the function is also 1-1, since adding one 
is always a 1-1 operation.

1.6.56
Here's how you do it.
The inverse function (-1 power) goes backwards from outputs to inputs.
(f o g)(x)=f(g(x)), so
f o g is the function that first does g then does f, so f is the LAST 
operation that gets applied and g is the FIRST one.
This means that (f o g)-inverse is the function that first 
goes backwards using f (since that is what we used last), then goes 
backwards using g (since that is where we got started with inputs).
Going backwards using f is f-inverse. Going backwards using g is g-inverse.
So going backwards all the way from the final output to the original 
input is also (g-inverse o f-inverse).
So these are the same function: 
(f o g)-inverse = (g-inverse o f-inverse).
