---BASE CASE---

Sum with j from 0 to 0 of 2j
2(0) = 0(0 + 1)
  0  =  0 CHECK
---INDUCTIVE PROOF---

Case j + 1 = 1
Just by what the word sum means,
we know that: 

the sum of the first 0 + 1 even postive
integers is the sum of the first 0 even
postive integers + 2(0 + 1)

By case 0,
the sum of the first 0 even positive
integers is 0(0 + 1).

So we can substitute in to get
the sum of the first 0 + 1 even positive
integers is 0(0 + 1) + 2(0 + 1).

Now just factor out (0 + 1) in back to get
0(0 + 1) + 2(0 + 1) = (0 + 1)(0 + 2)
= (0 + 1)((0 + 1) + 1).

Putting both together gives the sum of the first
1 = 0 + 1 even positive integers is
(0 + 1)((0 + 1) + 1).

CHECK COMPLETE for 1


Case j + 1 = 2
Just by what the word sum means,
we know that: 

the sum of the first 1 + 1 even postive
integers is the sum of the first 1 even
postive integers + 2(1 + 1)

By case 1,
the sum of the first 1 even positive
integers is 1(1 + 1).

So we can substitute in to get
the sum of the first 1 + 1 even positive
integers is 1(1 + 1) + 2(1 + 1).

Now just factor out (1 + 1) in back to get
1(1 + 1) + 2(1 + 1) = (1 + 1)(1 + 2)
= (1 + 1)((1 + 1) + 1).

Putting both together gives the sum of the first
2 = 1 + 1 even positive integers is
(1 + 1)((1 + 1) + 1).

CHECK COMPLETE for 2


Case j + 1 = 3
Just by what the word sum means,
we know that: 

the sum of the first 2 + 1 even postive
integers is the sum of the first 2 even
postive integers + 2(2 + 1)

By case 2,
the sum of the first 2 even positive
integers is 2(2 + 1).

So we can substitute in to get
the sum of the first 2 + 1 even positive
integers is 2(2 + 1) + 2(2 + 1).

Now just factor out (2 + 1) in back to get
2(2 + 1) + 2(2 + 1) = (2 + 1)(2 + 2)
= (2 + 1)((2 + 1) + 1).

Putting both together gives the sum of the first
3 = 2 + 1 even positive integers is
(2 + 1)((2 + 1) + 1).

CHECK COMPLETE for 3


Case j + 1 = 4
Just by what the word sum means,
we know that: 

the sum of the first 3 + 1 even postive
integers is the sum of the first 3 even
postive integers + 2(3 + 1)

By case 3,
the sum of the first 3 even positive
integers is 3(3 + 1).

So we can substitute in to get
the sum of the first 3 + 1 even positive
integers is 3(3 + 1) + 2(3 + 1).

Now just factor out (3 + 1) in back to get
3(3 + 1) + 2(3 + 1) = (3 + 1)(3 + 2)
= (3 + 1)((3 + 1) + 1).

Putting both together gives the sum of the first
4 = 3 + 1 even positive integers is
(3 + 1)((3 + 1) + 1).

CHECK COMPLETE for 4


Case j + 1 = 5
Just by what the word sum means,
we know that: 

the sum of the first 4 + 1 even postive
integers is the sum of the first 4 even
postive integers + 2(4 + 1)

By case 4,
the sum of the first 4 even positive
integers is 4(4 + 1).

So we can substitute in to get
the sum of the first 4 + 1 even positive
integers is 4(4 + 1) + 2(4 + 1).

Now just factor out (4 + 1) in back to get
4(4 + 1) + 2(4 + 1) = (4 + 1)(4 + 2)
= (4 + 1)((4 + 1) + 1).

Putting both together gives the sum of the first
5 = 4 + 1 even positive integers is
(4 + 1)((4 + 1) + 1).

CHECK COMPLETE for 5


Case j + 1 = 6
Just by what the word sum means,
we know that: 

the sum of the first 5 + 1 even postive
integers is the sum of the first 5 even
postive integers + 2(5 + 1)

By case 5,
the sum of the first 5 even positive
integers is 5(5 + 1).

So we can substitute in to get
the sum of the first 5 + 1 even positive
integers is 5(5 + 1) + 2(5 + 1).

Now just factor out (5 + 1) in back to get
5(5 + 1) + 2(5 + 1) = (5 + 1)(5 + 2)
= (5 + 1)((5 + 1) + 1).

Putting both together gives the sum of the first
6 = 5 + 1 even positive integers is
(5 + 1)((5 + 1) + 1).

CHECK COMPLETE for 6


Case j + 1 = 7
Just by what the word sum means,
we know that: 

the sum of the first 6 + 1 even postive
integers is the sum of the first 6 even
postive integers + 2(6 + 1)

By case 6,
the sum of the first 6 even positive
integers is 6(6 + 1).

So we can substitute in to get
the sum of the first 6 + 1 even positive
integers is 6(6 + 1) + 2(6 + 1).

Now just factor out (6 + 1) in back to get
6(6 + 1) + 2(6 + 1) = (6 + 1)(6 + 2)
= (6 + 1)((6 + 1) + 1).

Putting both together gives the sum of the first
7 = 6 + 1 even positive integers is
(6 + 1)((6 + 1) + 1).

CHECK COMPLETE for 7


Case j + 1 = 8
Just by what the word sum means,
we know that: 

the sum of the first 7 + 1 even postive
integers is the sum of the first 7 even
postive integers + 2(7 + 1)

By case 7,
the sum of the first 7 even positive
integers is 7(7 + 1).

So we can substitute in to get
the sum of the first 7 + 1 even positive
integers is 7(7 + 1) + 2(7 + 1).

Now just factor out (7 + 1) in back to get
7(7 + 1) + 2(7 + 1) = (7 + 1)(7 + 2)
= (7 + 1)((7 + 1) + 1).

Putting both together gives the sum of the first
8 = 7 + 1 even positive integers is
(7 + 1)((7 + 1) + 1).
